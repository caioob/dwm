# Caioob's build of dwm
This is my build of dwm that I use on my Arch installations. Just like my [dotfiles](https://github.com/caioob/dotfiles) it is based on Luke Smith's build that is present on [larbs](https://larbs.xyz) with a few modifications made by me.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

There is also a `PKGBUILD` usable on distributions with pacman. Run `makepkg -si` instead of `sudo make install`.
